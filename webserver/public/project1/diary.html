        <p>i should probably wake up
<br />
<br />
<br />

            i can hear my alarm ringing
            this was the 7th time that i've changed it
<br />

            i always blame the alarm
            for not waking me up
            or for not going off
<br />

            in truth
            i don't want to leave my dreamscape
            some things can only exist in memories
